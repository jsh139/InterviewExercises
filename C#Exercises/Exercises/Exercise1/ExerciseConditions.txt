Create new code and add it to an existing or new class library.

You don't need to create a console app and you don't need to execute your code.

Exercise Conditions:

Develop a class that contains a collection of 'Product' objects.

Provide an 'Add' method so that the Product objects can be added to your class
(don't worry about how the Product objects are instantiated).

Every Product has a price, a name and a description

Every Product has a type. These are the only possible types:
	Entertainment
	Educational
	Business

Provide a method that returns the Product having the lowest price for a 
specified type.
